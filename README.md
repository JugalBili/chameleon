# cs446-project Chameleon App
We created an app to help homeowners and interior designers to reimagine interior surfaces with different paints. The app utilizes machine learning models to crop out surfaces to recolour in a photo and recolours them with the desired paint colour by the user. The app also features a robust profile system to allow users to leave reviews on paints, save paints as favourites and view history of paints used for recolouring in the past
