# Dependencies
The android application portion of the app requires the following dependencies. Ensure you have them before beginning.

Dependencies:
- Latest version of Android Studio (2024.1.1)
- Version 14+ of Android (preferable but still supports older versions)
- Android API level 34+ (preferable but still supports older versions)
- Android physical device or virtual device to install the app

# Installation and build

Before proceeding, ensure that the backend servers are running.

Open the android application from the following directory
```bash
./frontend/Chameleon
```
This should be the root directory of the application once it is opened in Android Studio

# Running the application
Either run the application on the virtual device or a physical device

# Things to watch out for
1. Please be patient with the application! It interacts heavily with the backend servers and processing images may take 10-15 seconds!!

2. Please do not spam buttons as our backend hosting server is limited in resources (due to funding).

3. Sometimes, popups may show up due to long processing times. The app will not crash and will complete the render after some time!

# App demo link
The following demo shows a run through of how to use the app (different from the demo, users can sign up to create an account):
